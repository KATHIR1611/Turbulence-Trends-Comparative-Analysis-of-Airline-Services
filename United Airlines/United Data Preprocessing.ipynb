Upon arriving in Chicago from Barcelona on United plane,on September 25th my family and I discovered that our four bags were missing. At the United counter, I was informed that I needed to submit a claim for the missing bags at my final destination, Lincoln, NE. Unfortunately, our flight was delayed, and we arrived in Lincoln at 11:30 PM instead of 9 PM. I went straight to the United desk before the shift was over at midnight. At the United desk, I provided detailed information about the bags and received a claim number, reassured by the United rep that they would be found. I tracked two of the bags with GPS and saw they were still in Barcelona.

The airport itself has a weighing scale, where our bags were within the weight limit of 50 pounds. The United Airline check-in kiosk stated that our bags were a little overweight, which was suspicious. The funnier thing was that we rearranged the items in the two bags and the carry-on bags to make it fit their 'distorted' limits, but upon going to the main desk for dropping off the now labelled bags, their scale once again showed that the bags were overweight. The United staff were also very dismissive, arrogant-sounding, and not at all courteous of the passengers. It would be one thing if these were domestic travelers. But these are international travelers who have saved up for a vacation, and this is how United staff are representing the United States of America.

We were delayed 36 hours due to 2 different planes having \"maintenance issues\". They refuse to compensate us $300 in total for 2 people's expenses over that period. The CEO does not respond to a complaint. He apparently believes in leading his team, as has been reported on internet sites, so I can only presume he is happy that his staff do not ever respond on his behalf to a personal email, direct to him. Absolutely dreadful. Customer Services pass to refund team, who say there is no facility to refund a customer, only a travel credit to be used within a year. As we reside in UK, we will not use the credit in that time.

We stayed on the plane on the tarmac for at least 1.5 hours.
