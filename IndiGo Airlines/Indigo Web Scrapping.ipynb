The bag is badly torn and the car seat inside scratched when we received it at the destination. The bag which holds the car seat was expensive too and was not a flimsy one which would have gotten easily torn unless it was handled badly. We use the bag for the car seat exclusively for checking the car seat while flying and have been in 6 flights so far without any issues.  It is clear that the seat and bag were subjected to a lot of stress and abrasion and we will forever be doubting the structural integrity of the car seat which is worth over 75k INR due to Indigo's shoddy handling. We made Indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at VTZ. Without trying to understand the extent of the damage, Indigo's agent blindly offered 500 rupees. We did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount. She also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel. It is appalling that Indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business. We left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do. Agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) with her and use the PIR to later submit a claim to Indigo later. We later found out that leaving the airport without PIR means that we accepted everything was in good condition and cannot hold Indigo liable anymore.

They no longer provide fragile stickers, which is concerning for passengers with fragile items in their luggage. Additionally, considering it's an international flight, the basic fare does not include any complimentary meals or drinks. Even water is not provided unless specifically requested. The in-flight services are also overpriced, with a simple dish like poha costing over 300 rupees. Furthermore, there are no pillows or blankets provided, making the presence of five or six cabin crew members seem unnecessary if they are not providing any services.
