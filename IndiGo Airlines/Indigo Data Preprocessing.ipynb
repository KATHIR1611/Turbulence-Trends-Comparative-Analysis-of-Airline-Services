She reached Airport at 12:25 pm and there was a long que in front of check-in counter. She printed boarding pass 1 day ago and in that was they mentioned boarding time 12:40 Pm. She reached at counter by 12:25 Pm (1 hours before flight). Though she reached at time, they didn't allow her to go into the flight and asked her to pay 5000 rs extra to go to next flight in evening. She paid money through UPI but they didn't accept that receipt and She had to again pay 5000 rs by debit card. Without breaking any rule, She was charged 10,000 rs extra. (5000 Rs through UPI+ 5000 Rs through Debit card) and also couldn't go to flight and they rescheduled it.

They warned me that if i don't pay up I'll miss my flight and have to book another. I had to pay extra. when i arrived at my destination, i didn't get my luggage, they asked me to come back to airport to receive my luggage in the evening, but i got a call stating they'll send next day.

I have had heaps of bad experiences with Air India and had to forego many flights when they change schedule. When they change schedule and it does not suit you they refuse to provide you a refund and you lose the money. I preferred Indigo as I found the service good and had no problems until recently. I had booked return flights IXC-JDH in early July to fly in late August. A week ago on checking my bookings on their app I found they had changed my inbound flight from JDH to IXC from a layover in JAI to DEL. No issue with that. However there was no message or email from the airline of the change. I just happened to find out while going through my booking on the app. Not only that, the timing was changed from 1125 to 0925 hours. Had I not checked I would have missed my flight. As the new time was not suitable to me I called the airline. I was able to change to a later time. However I was told I must pay a change fee of INR 2000 per ticket. You change schedule and expect the customer to pay for it? I explained to the agent that this is an Involuntary change and I must not have to pay for it. The agent put me on hold to get an authorisation. I was able to amend the time without having to cough up the unreasonable charge. In such instances the agents should not require to get authorisation. They should be authorised to amend without wasting time on either end. Now after a week, I find out they have once again made a schedule change. They have now moved my flight from JDH to 1450 from 1025. I will arrive in DEL at 1625. However they have not amended my connecting flight DEL-IXC. That is scheduled at 1505, which will land in IXC before I even arrive in DEL. So I am back on the phone to Indigo. I requested them to put me on their DEL-IXC flt at 1725. Once again they are unable to do that. Was advised they will check and call me back. Got a call they are unwilling to put me on that flight. They want me to take a 5 hour layover in Delhi and arrive in IXC at 2230 instead of my original booked flight at 1500 hours. I once again pleaded my case. Was told they will check call me again. Again refused, obviously that is a peak hour flight and they would rather sell at a premium and let us helpless passengers waste time at the transit airport. No empathy at all. There is no recourse, either take it or leave it. I find this totally unacceptable and very poor service.

The bag is badly torn and the car seat inside scratched when we received it at the destination. The bag which holds the car seat was expensive too and was not a flimsy one which would have gotten easily torn unless it was handled badly. We use the bag for the car seat exclusively for checking the car seat while flying and have been in 6 flights so far without any issues.  It is clear that the seat and bag were subjected to a lot of stress and abrasion and we will forever be doubting the structural integrity of the car seat which is worth over 75k INR due to Indigo's shoddy handling. We made Indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at VTZ. Without trying to understand the extent of the damage, Indigo's agent blindly offered 500 rupees. We did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount. She also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel. It is appalling that Indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business. We left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do. Agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) with her and use the PIR to later submit a claim to Indigo later. We later found out that leaving the airport without PIR means that we accepted everything was in good condition and cannot hold Indigo liable anymore.

The in-flight services are also overpriced, with a simple dish like poha costing over 300 rupees. Furthermore, there are no pillows or blankets provided, making the presence of five or six cabin crew members seem unnecessary if they are not providing any services.

The 2 ladies of Cochin ground service was beyond rude and disrespectful and charged me 1000 extra for a luggage that was below the allowed amount under student discount. Their claim was that it was in 2 baggages instead of a single one. I am a frequent flyer and this has never occurred in any of the airports before including Cochin for the same type of services. So I am guessing this was specifically because of these 2 ladies who were themselves confused on how much to charge me and wasted 20 minutes.

First, the codeshare with Turkish does not work properly (it is impossible to make the web check-in online and to choose seats, we have to wait until we arrive at the airport). The schedule of this flight is very unconfortable, making us impossible to have a hotel breakfast before boarding. We had 1 hour delay and not a single cabin announcement to explain it. The captain was unable to make any announcement except a brief incomprehensible announcement just before landing. The onboard entertainment was not working and we had to make the whole journey with a white screen, without any idea of the time and our position. The stewardesses distributed water generously, but instead of a meal, I received only a tiny portion of vegetable curry. I was so hungry that I had to rush into a turkish restaurant at the Istanbul airport. The stewardesses are nice, but they still wear the ridiculous \"Girl power\" badge. …","Date":"2024-06-23","Stars":1,"Country":"Switzerland","Reviews":"indigo flight june bad codeshare turkish work properly impossible make web online choose wait arrive schedule flight making u impossible hotel breakfast hour delay single cabin announcement explain captain unable make announcement except brief incomprehensible announcement onboard entertainment working make whole journey white without idea time stewardess distributed water instead received tiny portion vegetable hungry rush turkish restaurant istanbul stewardess still wear ridiculous supporter gender shocked provocation would find nice also men","_deepnote_index_column":7},{"Review":"✅ Trip Verified |  My sister had flight today at 1:25 from Lucknow to Ahmedabad on 8th June 2024.
